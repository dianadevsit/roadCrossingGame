# roadCrossingGame

Welcome to my first game created with Phaser 3. I used Phaser 3, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript ES8 for this game. 

<b><u>Description:</u></b>

A casual, "Frogger" style game where the player will want to cross the game without getting hit with the floating obstacles to reach the goal on the other side.
